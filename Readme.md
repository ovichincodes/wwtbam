## About WWTBAM

WWTBAM is a desktop application package written in VB.NET programming language.
<br>
In 2018, a desire to extend my knowledge of programming, and an enthusiasm to contribute to the software development community, I built a simulation of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire live show, strictly for learning purposes.
<br>
Now, in 2021, this software package is now publicly accessible to juveniles and staff engineers in the field of software development.
Furthermore, I have attached herewith, photographs of the working system.
