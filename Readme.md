## About WWTBAM

WWTBAM is a desktop application written using the VB.NET programming language. As a beginner in 2018, I thought to make a little clone of the app I was using to play then just for learning purposes and nothing else. I'm making the code available here because it just might be of help to a beginner as well.

Below is the image of the desktop app I used.
